This was very daunting for me at the start of the task - I didn't really know how to set it up, and did a lot of planning as to what I was going to do, and how to go about it.

I decided to not worry about the whole and split it into task areas thus;
-Project definition: decide what I was going to build
-Database structure definition and table structure (in Figma)
-Sort out the SQL programming in Postgres
-Build the back end: link the database and create endpoints
-~Do the front end forms etc

Once I had that in my mind I could separate the individual tasks and not get overwhelmed with the enormity of it. And overcome my complete lack of ability evidenced in the previous message board task. It's the planning and working out what needs to be done, which is most difficult to me - I don't have the experience to know where to start on projects like this.

I also decided early on that a 4 was pretty much impossible for me, so treated it as a learning exercise: as such it was a success whatever I submit! i learned a lot.
